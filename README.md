## Game of Life

### Rules

```
1. If a live cell has less than 2 live neighbors; it dies
2. If a live cell has 2 or 3 live neighbors; next generation
3. If a live cell has more than 3 live neighbors; it dies/overpopulates
4. If a dead cell has 3 live neighbors; it becomes alive/reproduction
```

Initial pattern = seed of system
